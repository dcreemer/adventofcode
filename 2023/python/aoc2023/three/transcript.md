We are going to solve a programming puzzle using Python 3. The puzzle itself will
begin below the words "BEGIN PUZZLE".

You are an expert programmer. Create a solution to the puzzle with Python 3.12.
Try to break down the solution into small, testable functions.

Every function should use Python 3 type annotations in the function declaration.

Each function should include nice comments explaining its function.

For each function, create one or more test cases, using the "pytest" framework.

Avoid using complicated groups of pimitive types, and instead create
higher-level composite types. For example,
"List[Tuple[int, List[Dict[str, int]]]]" is a complicated type. Break that down
and create named types. For example, "Dict[str, int]" could factored out and given
a name specific to the problem.

Reading data from the file, parsing that data into the correct data structures,
and using the data to solve the puzzle should be at least three separate
functions. If you find that you are doing any complicated processing in a single
function, break it into smaller functions, and be sure each has appropriate test
cases in the tests file.

You will be given sample input to the puzzle. Use this input for the test cases
where appropriate. Include the input as a multi-line string inline in the test
file.

The real input for the puzzle will be provided later in a file called
"./aoc2023/DAY/input.txt". The main program should run, read that input file,
calculate the solution, and print it out.

BEGIN PUZZLE
You and the Elf eventually reach a gondola lift station; he says the gondola lift will take you up to the water source, but this is as far as he can bring you. You go inside.

It doesn't take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem: they're not moving.

"Aaah!"

You turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of surprise. "Sorry, I wasn't expecting anyone! The gondola lift isn't working right now; it'll still be a while before I can fix it." You offer to help.

The engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can add up all the part numbers in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.

The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don't really understand, but apparently any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a "part number" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (.) do not count as a symbol.)

Here is an example engine schematic:

467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..

In this schematic, two numbers are not part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: 114 (top right) and 58 (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so is a part number; their sum is 4361.

Of course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?
ChatGPT

To solve this puzzle, we'll break down the task into several steps and create Python functions for each. The key steps are:

    Parsing the Schematic: Read and parse the engine schematic into a suitable data structure.
    Identifying Part Numbers: Determine which numbers are adjacent to symbols and therefore count as part numbers.
    Summing Part Numbers: Calculate the sum of all valid part numbers.
    Main Program Logic: Read the real input, process it, and print the solution.

I'll define each function with Python 3.12 type annotations, comments, and create test cases using the pytest framework.
Step 1: Parsing the Schematic

First, we need a function to parse the schematic into a data structure. We'll use a list of lists (a 2D grid) to represent the schematic.

python

from typing import List

def parse_schematic(schematic_str: str) -> List[List[str]]:
    """
    Parses the engine schematic from a string into a 2D grid.

    Args:
    schematic_str (str): The string representation of the engine schematic.

    Returns:
    List[List[str]]: A 2D grid representation of the engine schematic.
    """
    return [list(line) for line in schematic_str.strip().split('\n')]

Step 2: Identifying Part Numbers

We need a function to identify which numbers are adjacent to symbols.

python

def is_adjacent_to_symbol(grid: List[List[str]], row: int, col: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a cell in the grid is adjacent to a symbol.

    Args:
    grid (List[List[str]]): The 2D grid representing the engine schematic.
    row (int): The row index of the cell.
    col (int): The column index of the cell.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the cell is adjacent to a symbol, False otherwise.
    """
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:
            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:
                continue
            r, c = row + dr, col + dc
            if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols and grid[r][c].isalpha():
                return True
    return False

Step 3: Summing Part Numbers

We need a function to sum all valid part numbers.

python

def sum_part_numbers(grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
    """
    Sums all valid part numbers in the engine schematic.

    Args:
    grid (List[List[str]]): The 2D grid representing the engine schematic.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of all valid part numbers.
    """
    sum_parts = 0
    for row in range(len(grid)):
        for col in range(len(grid[row])):
            if grid[row][col].isdigit() and is_adjacent_to_symbol(grid, row, col):
                sum_parts += int(grid[row][col])
    return sum_parts

Step 4: Main Program Logic

Finally, we combine these functions in the main logic of the program.

python

def main():
    with open("./aoc2023/DAY/input.txt", "r") as file:
        schematic = file.read()
    grid = parse_schematic(schematic)
    result = sum_part_numbers(grid)
    print(f"Sum of all part numbers: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Pytest Test Cases

For testing, we'll use the example schematic provided in the puzzle.

python

def test_parse_schematic():
    example_schematic = "467..114..\n...*......\n..35..633.\n......#...\n617*......\n.....+.58.\n..592.....\n......755.\n...$.*....\n.664.598.."
    grid = parse_schematic(example_schematic)
    assert len(grid) == 10
    assert len(grid[0]) == 10

def test_sum_part_numbers():
    example_schematic = "467..114..\n...*......\n..35..633.\n......#...\n617*......\n.....+.58.\n..592.....\n......755.\n...$.*....\n.664.598.."
    grid = parse_schematic(example_schematic)
    assert sum_part_numbers(grid) == 4361

These functions and tests provide a structured approach to solving the puzzle. The test cases ensure that each function works as expected.
User
the test in "is_adjacent_to_symbol" doesn't look right. The problem says that symbols are anything that isn't a number or the "." character. Please rewrite the test
ChatGPT

You're right, the is_adjacent_to_symbol function needs to consider symbols as anything other than a number or a period. Let's adjust the function accordingly and update its test cases.
Adjusted is_adjacent_to_symbol Function

python

def is_adjacent_to_symbol(grid: List[List[str]], row: int, col: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a cell in the grid is adjacent to a symbol.

    Args:
    grid (List[List[str]]): The 2D grid representing the engine schematic.
    row (int): The row index of the cell.
    col (int): The column index of the cell.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the cell is adjacent to a symbol, False otherwise.
    """
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:
            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:
                continue
            r, c = row + dr, col + dc
            if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols and not grid[r][c].isdigit() and grid[r][c] != '.':
                return True
    return False

Updated Test Cases for is_adjacent_to_symbol

Now, let's write test cases for is_adjacent_to_symbol to ensure it works as expected with the updated logic.

python

def test_is_adjacent_to_symbol():
    grid = [
        list("467..114.."),
        list("...*......"),
        list("..35..633."),
        list("......#..."),
        list("617*......"),
        list(".....+.58."),
        list("..592....."),
        list("......755."),
        list("...$.*...."),
        list(".664.598..")
    ]

    # Test a few cases
    assert is_adjacent_to_symbol(grid, 0, 0)  # Adjacent to '*'
    assert not is_adjacent_to_symbol(grid, 0, 5)  # Not adjacent to any symbol
    assert is_adjacent_to_symbol(grid, 4, 3)  # Adjacent to '+'
    assert not is_adjacent_to_symbol(grid, 9, 9)  # Not adjacent to any symbol

These test cases cover a few scenarios to validate the functionality of is_adjacent_to_symbol. They ensure that the function correctly identifies whether a cell is adjacent to a symbol according to the puzzle's rules.
User
factor out the test for a symbol into a separate function and then use it
ChatGPT

Certainly! We can create a separate function to check if a character is a symbol according to the puzzle's rules and then use this function in is_adjacent_to_symbol. This will make our code more modular and easier to test.
New Function to Check for Symbol

python

def is_symbol(char: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a character is a symbol.

    A symbol is defined as anything that isn't a digit or a period.

    Args:
    char (str): The character to check.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the character is a symbol, False otherwise.
    """
    return not char.isdigit() and char != '.'

Updated is_adjacent_to_symbol Function

Now, we'll use is_symbol in is_adjacent_to_symbol.

python

def is_adjacent_to_symbol(grid: List[List[str]], row: int, col: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a cell in the grid is adjacent to a symbol.

    Args:
    grid (List[List[str]]): The 2D grid representing the engine schematic.
    row (int): The row index of the cell.
    col (int): The column index of the cell.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the cell is adjacent to a symbol, False otherwise.
    """
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:
            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:
                continue
            r, c = row + dr, col + dc
            if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols and is_symbol(grid[r][c]):
                return True
    return False

Test Cases

Let's write test cases for both is_symbol and the updated is_adjacent_to_symbol.

python

def test_is_symbol():
    assert is_symbol('*')
    assert not is_symbol('4')
    assert not is_symbol('.')

def test_is_adjacent_to_symbol():
    grid = [
        list("467..114.."),
        list("...*......"),
        list("..35..633."),
        list("......#..."),
        list("617*......"),
        list(".....+.58."),
        list("..592....."),
        list("......755."),
        list("...$.*...."),
        list(".664.598..")
    ]

    # Test a few cases
    assert is_adjacent_to_symbol(grid, 0, 0)  # Adjacent to '*'
    assert not is_adjacent_to_symbol(grid, 0, 5)  # Not adjacent to any symbol
    assert is_adjacent_to_symbol(grid, 4, 3)  # Adjacent to '+'
    assert not is_adjacent_to_symbol(grid, 9, 9)  # Not adjacent to any symbol

These test cases should adequately validate both the is_symbol function and the is_adjacent_to_symbol function after its refactoring.
User
the problem is more complicated than you have solved. A "number" in the schematic input could be a multi-digit number, like "467". Your code tests if each digit at a specific row, column is adjacent to a symbol. In the sample input, starting with the first row, the first number we encounter is "467", and the second is "114", and the third is "35". Rewrite your code to check if the area around each of these numbers has a symbol
ChatGPT

You're correct, and I appreciate your clarification. In the puzzle, a "number" can indeed be a multi-digit number, and we need to adjust our approach to identify these numbers and check if they are adjacent to symbols. We'll modify the solution with the following steps:

    Identify Numbers in the Grid: Extract multi-digit numbers from the grid.
    Check Adjacency for Each Number: Determine if each identified number is adjacent to a symbol.
    Sum the Valid Numbers: Sum the numbers that are adjacent to symbols.

Step 1: Identify Numbers in the Grid

We need a function to scan the grid and extract all multi-digit numbers, along with their positions.

python

from typing import Tuple, List

def find_numbers(grid: List[List[str]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, str]]:
    """
    Finds all numbers in the grid and their positions.

    Args:
    grid (List[List[str]]): The 2D grid representing the engine schematic.

    Returns:
    List[Tuple[int, int, str]]: A list of tuples containing row, column, and the number as a string.
    """
    numbers = []
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    for row in range(rows):
        col = 0
        while col < cols:
            if grid[row][col].isdigit():
                number_start = col
                while col < cols and grid[row][col].isdigit():
                    col += 1
                numbers.append((row, number_start, ''.join(grid[row][number_start:col])))
            else:
                col += 1
    return numbers

Step 2: Check Adjacency for Each Number

Now we adjust the adjacency check to work with the complete numbers.

python

def is_number_adjacent_to_symbol(grid: List[List[str]], row: int, start_col: int, number: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a number in the grid is adjacent to a symbol.

    Args:
    grid (List[List[str]]): The 2D grid representing the engine schematic.
    row (int): The row index of the number.
    start_col (int): The starting column index of the number.
    number (str): The number as a string.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the number is adjacent to a symbol, False otherwise.
    """
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    end_col = start_col + len(number)

    for r in range(row - 1, row + 2):
        for c in range(start_col - 1, end_col + 1):
            if r >= 0 and r < rows and c >= 0 and c < cols and is_symbol(grid[r][c]):
                return True
    return False

Step 3: Sum the Valid Numbers

Finally, we modify the summing function to use these new functions.

python

def sum_valid_numbers(grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
    """
    Sums all valid numbers in the engine schematic.

    Args:
    grid (List[List[str]]): The 2D grid representing the engine schematic.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of all valid numbers.
    """
    total_sum = 0
    for row, col, number in find_numbers(grid):
        if is_number_adjacent_to_symbol(grid, row, col, number):
            total_sum += int(number)
    return total_sum

Test Cases

Let's update our test cases to reflect these changes.

python

def test_find_numbers():
    grid = parse_schematic("467..114..\n...*......\n..35..633.\n......#...\n617*......\n.....+.58.\n..592.....\n......755.\n...$.*....\n.664.598..")
    numbers = find_numbers(grid)
    assert (0, 0, "467") in numbers
    assert (0, 5, "114") in numbers
    assert (2, 2, "35") in numbers

def test_is_number_adjacent_to_symbol():
    grid = parse_schematic("467..114..\n...*......\n..35..633.\n......#...\n617*......\n.....+.58.\n..592.....\n......755.\n...$.*....\n.664.598..")
    assert is_number_adjacent_to_symbol(grid, 0, 0, "467")
    assert not is_number_adjacent_to_symbol(grid, 0, 5, "114")
    assert is_number_adjacent_to_symbol(grid, 2, 2, "35")

def test_sum_valid_numbers():
    grid = parse_schematic("467..114..\n...*......\n..35..633.\n......#...\n617*......\n.....+.58.\n

User
Here is an update to the puzzle, found after the words "UPDATED PUZZLE". Write
more python functions and tests following the same instructions as before to
solve this updated puzzle.

UPDATED PUZZLE
The engineer finds the missing part and installs it in the engine! As the engine springs to life, you jump in the closest gondola, finally ready to ascend to the water source.

You don't seem to be going very fast, though. Maybe something is still wrong? Fortunately, the gondola has a phone labeled "help", so you pick it up and the engineer answers.

Before you can explain the situation, she suggests that you look out the window. There stands the engineer, holding a phone in one hand and waving with the other. You're going so slowly that you haven't even left the station. You exit the gondola.

The missing part wasn't the only issue - one of the gears in the engine is wrong. A gear is any * symbol that is adjacent to exactly two part numbers. Its gear ratio is the result of multiplying those two numbers together.

This time, you need to find the gear ratio of every gear and add them all up so that the engineer can figure out which gear needs to be replaced.

Consider the same engine schematic again:

467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..

In this schematic, there are two gears. The first is in the top left; it has part numbers 467 and 35, so its gear ratio is 16345. The second gear is in the lower right; its gear ratio is 451490. (The * adjacent to 617 is not a gear because it is only adjacent to one part number.) Adding up all of the gear ratios produces 467835.

What is the sum of all of the gear ratios in your engine schematic?
ChatGPT

To solve this updated puzzle, we need to modify our approach to identify gears and calculate their gear ratios. A gear is defined as any '*' symbol adjacent to exactly two part numbers. The gear ratio is the product of these two numbers. Finally, we sum up all the gear ratios. Here's the plan:

    Identify Gears: Find all '*' symbols in the grid and check if they are adjacent to exactly two part numbers.
    Calculate Gear Ratios: For each identified gear, calculate the product of the two adjacent numbers.
    Sum Gear Ratios: Add up all the gear ratios to get the final answer.

Step 1: Identify Gears

We'll modify our number-finding function to also return the adjacent symbols for each number. This will help us identify gears efficiently.

python

def find_numbers_with_symbols(grid: List[List[str]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, str, List[str]]]:
    """
    Finds all numbers in the grid, their positions, and adjacent symbols.

    Args:
    grid (List[List[str]]): The 2D grid representing the engine schematic.

    Returns:
    List[Tuple[int, int, str, List[str]]]: A list of tuples containing row, column, 
                                           the number as a string, and a list of adjacent symbols.
    """
    numbers = []
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    for row in range(rows):
        col = 0
        while col < cols:
            if grid[row][col].isdigit():
                number_start = col
                adjacent_symbols = []
                while col < cols and grid[row][col].isdigit():
                    for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                        adj_row, adj_col = row + dr, col + dc
                        if 0 <= adj_row < rows and 0 <= adj_col < cols and grid[adj_row][adj_col] == '*':
                            adjacent_symbols.append((adj_row, adj_col))
                    col += 1
                numbers.append((row, number_start, ''.join(grid[row][number_start:col]), adjacent_symbols))
            else:
                col += 1
    return numbers

Step 2: Calculate Gear Ratios

Now, we calculate the gear ratios.

python

def calculate_gear_ratios(numbers: List[Tuple[int, int, str, List[str]]]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Calculates the gear ratios for all identified gears.

    Args:
    numbers (List[Tuple[int, int, str, List[str]]]): The list of numbers and their adjacent symbols.

    Returns:
    List[int]: A list of calculated gear ratios.
    """
    gear_ratios = []
    gears_checked = set()

    for _, _, number, adjacent_symbols in numbers:
        for symbol_pos in adjacent_symbols:
            if symbol_pos not in gears_checked:
                gears_checked.add(symbol_pos)
                adjacent_numbers = [int(number)]
                for other_number, _, _, other_adjacent_symbols in numbers:
                    if symbol_pos in other_adjacent_symbols and other_number != number:
                        adjacent_numbers.append(int(other_number))
                if len(adjacent_numbers) == 2:
                    gear_ratios.append(adjacent_numbers[0] * adjacent_numbers[1])

    return gear_ratios

Step 3: Sum Gear Ratios

Finally, we sum the gear ratios.

python

def sum_gear_ratios(grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
    """
    Sums all the gear ratios in the engine schematic.

    Args:
    grid (List[List[str]]): The 2D grid representing the engine schematic.

    Returns:

    """
    numbers = find_numbers_with_symbols(grid)
    gear_ratios = calculate_gear_ratios(numbers)
    return sum(gear_ratios)

Test Cases

Let's write test cases for these new functions.

python

def test_find_numbers_with_symbols():
    grid = parse_schematic("467..114..\n...*......\n..35..633.\n......#...\n617*......\n.....+.58.\n..592.....\n......755.\n...$.*....\n.664.598..")
    numbers = find_numbers_with_symbols(grid)
    assert (0, 0, "467", [(0, 3)]) in numbers  # 467 is adjacent to a gear at (0, 3)

def test_calculate_gear_ratios():
    numbers = [(0, 0, "467", [(0, 3)]), (2, 2, "35", [(0, 3)]), (9, 4, "598", [(8, 4)])]
    gear_ratios = calculate_gear_ratios(numbers)
    assert 16345 in gear_ratios  # Gear ratio for gear at (0, 3)
    assert 451490 in gear_ratios  # Gear ratio for gear at (8, 4)

def test_sum_gear_ratios():

    assert sum_gear_ratios(grid) == 467835

These functions and test cases should solve the updated puzzle, identifying gears and calculating their gear ratios correctly.

the function "find_numbers_with_symbols" says it returns "and a list of adjacent symbols", but the code "adjacent_symbols.append((adj_row, adj_col))" adds coordinates, not the symbol to the list "adjacent_symbols". fix that
ChatGPT

You're absolutely right. The find_numbers_with_symbols function currently adds the coordinates of adjacent symbols, not the symbols themselves, to the adjacent_symbols list. To align with the function's description and the requirements of the puzzle, we should modify it to include the actual symbols ('*') instead of their coordinates. Let's fix that:
Updated find_numbers_with_symbols Function

python

def find_numbers_with_symbols(grid: List[List[str]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, str, List[str]]]:
    """
    Finds all numbers in the grid, their positions, and adjacent symbols.

    Args:
    grid (List[List[str]]): The 2D grid representing the engine schematic.

    Returns:
    List[Tuple[int, int, str, List[str]]]: A list of tuples containing row, column, 
                                           the number as a string, and a list of adjacent symbols.
    """
    numbers = []
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    for row in range(rows):
        col = 0
        while col < cols:
            if grid[row][col].isdigit():
                number_start = col
                adjacent_gears = []
                while col < cols and grid[row][col].isdigit():
                    for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                        adj_row, adj_col = row + dr, col + dc
                        if 0 <= adj_row < rows and 0 <= adj_col < cols and grid[adj_row][adj_col] == '*':
                            adjacent_gears.append('*')
                    col += 1
                numbers.append((row, number_start, ''.join(grid[row][number_start:col]), adjacent_gears))
            else:
                col += 1
    return numbers

In this revised version, adjacent_gears is a list that contains the symbol '*' for each gear adjacent to a number. This change should align the function's behavior with its intended purpose, and also facilitate the subsequent calculations for identifying gears and computing gear ratios.
Test Cases

The test cases should be updated to reflect this change:

python

def test_find_numbers_with_symbols():
    grid = parse_schematic("467..114..\n...*......\n..35..633.\n......#...\n617*......\n.....+.58.\n..592.....\n......755.\n...$.*....\n.664.598..")
    numbers = find_numbers_with_symbols(grid)
    # Checking that '*' symbols are correctly identified adjacent to numbers
    assert (0, 0, "467", ['*']) in numbers
    assert (2, 2, "35", ['*']) in numbers
    assert (9, 4, "598", []) in numbers  # No gears adjacent

These adjustments should now ensure that find_numbers_with_symbols works correctly according to the problem's requirements.
User
when testing for adjacent symbols, the function needs to include diagonals. Your code does not. For example, in the sample input, the number 467 is in row 0, columns 0 through 2. At row 1 column 4, there is a "*". This is diagonally adjacent to the "7" in "467" on row zero. Update the function "find_numbers_with_symbols" to include diagonally adjacent symbols
ChatGPT

Understood. To account for diagonally adjacent symbols, the function find_numbers_with_symbols needs to consider not just the horizontal and vertical neighbors of each digit in a number, but also the diagonal ones. Let's update the function accordingly:
Updated find_numbers_with_symbols Function

python

def find_numbers_with_symbols(grid: List[List[str]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, str, List[str]]]:
    """

                                           the number as a string, and a list of adjacent symbols.
    """
    numbers = []
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    for row in range(rows):
        col = 0
        while col < cols:
            if grid[row][col].isdigit():
                number_start = col
                adjacent_gears = set()
                while col < cols and grid[row][col].isdigit():
                    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:
                        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:
                            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:
                                continue  # Skip the number itself
                            adj_row, adj_col = row + dr, col + dc
                            if 0 <= adj_row < rows and 0 <= adj_col < cols and grid[adj_row][adj_col] == '*':
                                adjacent_gears.add('*')
                    col += 1
                numbers.append((row, number_start, ''.join(grid[row][number_start:col]), list(adjacent_gears)))
            else:
                col += 1
    return numbers

In this revised version, the nested loops for dr and dc iterate over the eight directions surrounding a digit (including diagonals). This ensures that all adjacent gears, including those diagonally adjacent, are considered.
Test Cases

We should update the test cases to verify this change:

python

def test_find_numbers_with_symbols():
    grid = parse_schematic("467..114..\n...*......\n..35..633.\n......#...\n617*......\n.....+.58.\n..592.....\n......755.\n...$.*....\n.664.598..")
    numbers = find_numbers_with_symbols(grid)
    # Checking that '*' symbols are correctly identified adjacent to numbers including diagonals
    assert (0, 0, "467", ['*']) in numbers  # '*' at (1, 4) is diagonally adjacent to the '7' in '467'
    assert (2, 2, "35", ['*']) in numbers  # '*' at (0, 3) is adjacent to '35'
    assert (9, 4, "598", []) in numbers  # No gears adjacent

These adjustments ensure that find_numbers_with_symbols now correctly accounts for diagonally adjacent symbols as well.
User
Let's go back to returning the position of the "*" symbols in the find_numbers_with_symbols function. you were right to begin with
ChatGPT

Understood, let's revert to returning the positions of '*' symbols in the find_numbers_with_symbols function. This approach is beneficial for identifying the exact location of gears, which is essential for the updated puzzle requirements. We'll also ensure to include diagonal adjacency in this revised version.

            else:

    return numbers

This function now captures the positions of '*' symbols that are adjacent (including diagonally) to each number.
Test Cases

We should adjust our test cases accordingly to reflect this change:

python

def test_find_numbers_with_symbols():
    grid = parse_schematic("467..114..\n...*......\n..35..633.\n......#...\n617*......\n.....+.58.\n..592.....\n......755.\n...$.*....\n.664.598..")
    numbers = find_numbers_with_symbols(grid)
    # Testing with updated function to return '*' positions
    assert (0, 0, "467", [(1, 4)]) in numbers  # '*' at (1, 4) is diagonally adjacent to the '7' in '467'
    assert (2, 2, "35", [(0, 3)]) in numbers  # '*' at (0, 3) is adjacent to '35'
    assert (9, 4, "598", []) in numbers  # No gears adjacent

These test cases now validate that the function correctly identifies the positions of adjacent gears to each number, taking into account diagonal adjacency.
User
now please update "calculate_gear_ratios" to take the output of "find_numbers_with_symbols" as its input
ChatGPT

To update the calculate_gear_ratios function, we'll take the output of find_numbers_with_symbols as its input. This function will iterate through the numbers and their adjacent gear positions to calculate the gear ratios. We need to modify it to handle the case where a gear ('*') is adjacent to exactly two part numbers and calculate the product of these two numbers.
Updated calculate_gear_ratios Function

python

def calculate_gear_ratios(numbers_with_symbols: List[Tuple[int, int, str, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the sum of gear ratios for all identified gears.

    Args:
    numbers_with_symbols (List[Tuple[int, int, str, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]): 
        The list of numbers and positions of their adjacent '*' symbols.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of all gear ratios.
    """
    gear_ratios = []
    gears_checked = set()

    # Mapping gears to the numbers they are adjacent to
    gear_to_numbers = {}
    for _, _, number, gears in numbers_with_symbols:
        for gear_pos in gears:
            if gear_pos not in gear_to_numbers:
                gear_to_numbers[gear_pos] = []
            gear_to_numbers[gear_pos].append(int(number))
    
    # Calculating gear ratios for gears adjacent to exactly two numbers
    for gear_pos, adjacent_numbers in gear_to_numbers.items():
        if len(adjacent_numbers) == 2 and gear_pos not in gears_checked:
            gears_checked.add(gear_pos)
            gear_ratios.append(adjacent_numbers[0] * adjacent_numbers[1])

    return sum(gear_ratios)

In this updated function, we first create a mapping of each gear to the numbers it is adjacent to. Then, we iterate through this mapping to calculate the gear ratio for each gear that is adjacent to exactly two numbers. Finally, we return the sum of all these gear ratios.
Test Case for Updated calculate_gear_ratios

Let's write a test case for this updated function:

python

def test_calculate_gear_ratios():
    numbers_with_symbols = [
        (0, 0, "467", [(1, 4)]),  # '*' at (1, 4) diagonally adjacent to '467'
        (2, 2, "35", [(0, 3)]),   # '*' at (0, 3) adjacent to '35'
        (9, 4, "598", []),        # No gears adjacent to '598'
        (4, 0, "617", [(4, 3)])   # '*' at (4, 3) adjacent to '617', but no second number
    ]
    assert calculate_gear_ratios(numbers_with_symbols) == 16345 + 451490  # Gear ratios for (1, 4) and (0, 3) gears

This test case covers a scenario where there are two gears, each adjacent to exactly two numbers, and verifies that the function correctly calculates the sum of their gear ratios.
